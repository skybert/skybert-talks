# Talks ðŸŽ¤
Hi, I'm Skybert ðŸ‘‹,

I like to give talks on technology I care about. Spreading the
knowledge and joy of using this wonderful technology makes me happy.

I publish a new video on my YouTube channel [Skybert
Hacks](https://youtube.com/@skybert) approximately every fortnight on
topics like Emacs, Unix, Linux, Java, Python and BASH.

If you'd like me to give a talk about something, give me a shout at
